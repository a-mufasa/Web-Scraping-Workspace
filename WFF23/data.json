The creamy, robust flavors of our aged blue cheese was discovered by accident over 20 years ago. Some \"past date\" blue cheese being stored in a foothills mineshaft was offered to John Gibson Sr. (founder of Shaft's). Curious to learn what this additional aging and environment would do for the blue cheese, he decided he had to taste it. What he found knocked his socks off. He knew he had found a special blue cheese that he had to share with others. What followed was carefully selecting the best milk, cheesemaker, and perfecting the aging environment. We wanted to get it just right.

Tomatoes grow all over the world, and they are all delicious, but the San Marzanos grow in the fertile volcanic soil at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, under the Mediterranean sun.  They are picked at the peak of their ripeness and then preserved to become \"San Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino DOP\".  When choosing canned tomatoes, look out for this label that assures you of the quality and identification of these special tomatoes.  Enjoy.
