# Web Scraping Workspace

Repository for the code belonging to one-off web scraping/parsing projects. Note that some of these websites are **private**, therefore you may not be able to run the scraping/parsing for them. As such, any private data will be omitted from this repository.

Each scraper directory will contain it's own `README.md` providing the corresponding instructions.
